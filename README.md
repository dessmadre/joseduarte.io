# Oh-say.media (My Portfolio)

## Technologies I want to use for my portfolio

- Three.js

  - @react-three/fiber
  - @react-three/drei
  - @react-three/cannon

  ```zsh
  yarn add three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei @react-three/cannon
  ```

## What do i want to build with it

- Macbook 3d model that will work as my hero image similar to [Panic](https://panic.com/transmit/ 'https://panic.com/transmit/')

## Problems using this technology

- No prior experience using Three.js
  - the only experiece i have is the videos i saw on udemy
  - I plan to overcome this by following youtube tutorials on Blender so that I can get working knowledge of creating custom GTLF models and animations
- Learning how to use Three js in a React project
- I do have [resources] (https://sbcode.net/threejs/ "Sean Bradley Three.js tutorial") on the vairous modules included with three.js, it will just take practice to be able to build my models
