This is my second version of my Web Development portfolio. I have a major inspiration for the design of my portfolio, [Transmit 5](https://panic.com/transmit/). I really liked their spinning truck and I decided to create a model of my laptop and use it in a similar manner.

I used Next.js to build this website, over React because I didn't want to have to create a seperate backend in order to use SendGrid.

I styled the website using a combination of TailwindCSS and CSS

The major challenges working on this project were figuring out Three.js and creating the site navigation. This is the first project where I use Three.js, luckily they have some easy to understand documentation. The biggest struggle was during implementation was setting up the scene camera. I overcame this challenge by using Blender. I set my camera within the software, when I exported it and used it in my application I set the Three.js camera to the same one saved in the Blender file. The second challenge was creating a navigation that would help visitors navigate a single page application. I was able to acheive the functionality I was lloking for in my nagivation by using React references and JavaScripts intersection observer.
