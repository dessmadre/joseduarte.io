purpose: This is one of the applications that I always wanted to make and using Pusher to create made it easier than I thought it was going to be.
challenges: Some of my biggest challenges were setting up the Pusher SDK with the serverless functionality that Next.js offers, but after I managed to get that too work I was easy to set up the application to fuction the way I wanted it to.
